## An online map, tailor-made by you. With your information. Published by you.

You have your own idea of looking at maps. You are the professional who knows what the map should be about. Maybe you are interested in public space, in parks, environmental data or in the intricate networks of electricity and water. Probably you want to combine different features. But most of all, you are interested in showing the information that you need in your work. No more, and definitely no less. You can do this with your Tailormap GIS-viewer.
